Small Arduino NANO controller for two RGB LED stripes with 16 modes
and independent RGB/HSV analogic controls for each channel.

Includes a 16 mode selector (a hexadecimal rotary switch) to switch between
RGB and HSV mode for each channel independently and propagate/invert
the settings on one channel to the other.\
**More choices = more freedom! :D**

This is an upgrade from the basic RGB controller also available in this repo.
