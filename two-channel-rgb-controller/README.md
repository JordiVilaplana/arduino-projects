Small Arduino NANO controller for two RGB LED stripes with independent
RGB analogic controls for each stripe.

Includes a 3 positions (2 channels) toggle switch to propagate the settings
on one channel to the other. That way you can test two lighting colors
side by side and then use the one you like the most. :)

It was first conceived as a controller for a DIY softbox or studio light
for photography and video production, but can be used for any dual color
illumination purposes.
